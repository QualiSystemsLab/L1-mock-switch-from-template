# L1-mock-switch-from-template
The **L1 Mock Switch** L1 driver is based on the *layer-1-switch* shell template and is intended for training purposes, to allow users to familiarize themselves with Layer 1 switches in CloudLShell without needing an actual layer 1 switch.  

End users will be able to create routes, configure port settings, and read values from the switch using the CloudShell Portal, Resource Manager client, or the CloudShell API.
